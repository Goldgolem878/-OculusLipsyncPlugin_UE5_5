After import your files .wav in Unreal Engine 5.3, open file and change/set Loading Behavior Override to “Force Inline”. And after that can create lipsync animation.

apparently:
"
if your OVRLipSyncSequence doesn't show disk size of created Sequence

-save generated file
-exit and enter the folder where its generated

That will fix the problem
